- 👋 Hi, I’m @Palitir
- 👀 I’m interested in Gamedev and 3D design.
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning the Unreal Engine after a LONG TIME AWAY!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small scale projects, indydev and such. got a lot to relearn and catch up on. 
- 💞️ My last projects involved an accurate 24H day/night cycle and development of 100% procedurally generated building meshes.
